## Background

This project illustrates using RStudio Connect to deploy a Python data science project featuring:

![](../img/bikeshare_python.png)

### Scheduled jobs

- Training predictive models using data from a database and R pins on RStudio Connect.

### Pins

- Serving trained models for use in apps, APIs, and other jobs.

### APIs / Vetiver

- Deploying models as a REST API and monitoring model performance using vetiver.

### Development and Production Apps
  
- Exposing model predictions to end-users via Shiny fo Python apps.
- Using git-backed deployment to keep a stable version of the application available from the main branch while doing development work on another branch.
